# Odd-Minute
Checks to see if current minute is odd or even.  Created with Python.

#The logic behind the script is fairly basic.  It imports the datetime module which allows us to check the physical time on your local host by using a subclass of the module 
datetime.today().minute.  This is able to compare the exact minutes on your local host to the variable odds that was declared in order to decide whether the minute the script 
was odd or even.
